Welcome to the DataModel.Quiz program!

I. Create DataModel.Quiz
    There are three types of questions: Multi-choice, Written, and True/False. In order to load the quiz, you must first create one.
    Click on "Build New DataModel.Quiz" -> Type in the name of the quiz and click "OK" -> new Pop-up Window.
    Once you've gotten to the window, you will see a table on the left and the text field, drop down option on the right.
    The text field on the top is where you'd put your questions. If it's empty, you won't be able to submit your question.
    Once finished typing the quiz, now choose one of the items in the drop down menu for your answer.
    For the True/False option, you'd just have to choose one of the buttons to indicate your correct answer.
    The Multi-Choice option would have text fields and buttons as well.
    You must indicate the correct answer by ticking one of the choices and type in the answer in the text field.
    The Written option would show you the text field by itself. Type in your answer.
    Once finished, submit your answer, if any one of the fields is missing, it will give you a warning.
    If successful, the table will be populated with your question. You can now click on it and check if it's proper.
    Once clicked the side view will now show the preview of the question that you have clicked.
    To go back, you can click the button on the top right corner and it will switch to the editor view.
    To delete questions, right click the cell in the table and click on "Delete".
    Once finished, click on the left corner to save and exit. To not save, just click on the exit button and click "OK".

II. Edit DataModel.Quiz
    After creating the quiz, there might have been something that you'd forgot to add or mistake that had been made with the content.
    During creation, it is not possible for any change to be made once it had been submitted.
    However, the user can edit them once it had been created/submitted to the program. The editor window is similar in design. However,
    in the editor window, you can modify previous contents, whether it is the question or the answer, or submit new questions.
    Once edits had been made, click on the left corner to save and exit. The changes will be permanent and the user would have to save to exit.

III. Load DataModel.Quiz
    When clicked, this will show a list of quizzes that are available. Click on one of the cells and "Submit". Once submitted, the new window
    will be shown. Once finished choosing the answer, click on "Next", which is located on the bottom right corner. If the answer was wrong,
    the thumb down animation will play. If right, the thumb up animation will be played. The score board will store all chosen/correct answers
    and will be able to be viewed after the quiz.

IV. Score Board
    The Score Board will keep each instance of the quiz. It will show as the time that the user had taken the quiz and once click "Submit", the
    user will be able to view his/her response as well as the correct answer for the corresponding question.
    It will also show the score on the bottom of the window.
